5.working with/creating button
6.creating effects such as hovering

at this time there are 2 branches 
master .... link is :https://goofy-edison-277e47.netlify.app/
first attempt it however does not contain a dropdown nav bar or hamburger menu

it is somewhat responsive, but still requires more work
